		  <h1>Intro</h1>
		  <p>Graphic Designer/Mountain Biker/Soccer Fanatic/Salsa Dancer/Spanish-English music listener. 
		  </p>

		  <h1>What's important to me</h1>
		  <p>I appreciate smart, simple and effective results, almost indiscriminately I tend to appreciate the beauty of great execution in everything that surrounds me, be it nature's tiny miracles, be it a well directed tv show, a masterfuly written article, a carefully executed picture, a practical feature on a device, and/or  new mind-twisting ways to create beautiful pieces.</p>

		  <h1>Where am I from?</h1>
		  <p>I'm originally from Colombia, here are some random facts most people don't know about Colombia: Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world (plants, birds, insects, you name it). Bogota -the capital city- has South America’s largest network of bicycle routes. Colombia is on the equator, so expect almost no seasons and much heat and sun throughout the year! The country’s name is spelled Col-o-mbia, not Col-u-mbia. Many non-Spanish speakers get this wrong.</p>

		  <h1>What's my dream job?</h1>
		  <p>My dream job would be one where it's not measured by results but by ingenuity. A job that encourages me to explore new ways to improve processes, ideas, to try new vehicles of communication and see how effective they can be, where there's room for experimentation and the learning curve is being shaped by teamwork and honest trial and error.
